# QR-Code

The QR-Code feature is part of the [Imixs-Adapters project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-adapters/tree/master/imixs-adapters-qrcode). 


In Imixs-Office-Workflow the search feature can be activated by setting the imixs.property:

	qr-code.url.prafix=http://root.url.comoffice?workitem=
	qr-code.url.sufix=

This property is not a default property.
