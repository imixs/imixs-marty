# Imixs-Marty - Plugins

In a Imixs-Worklfow application main part of the business logic is encapsulated in the BPMN model or implemented by custom plug-in classes. 
The Imixs-Marty project provides plugins to extend general workflow behavior. 
The plug-in concept enables a client to access these business logic through all the different interfaces from 
 the imixs workflow. For example a RESTfull service client has the same functionality like a JSF web client as far as the 
 business logic is encapsulated into plugins.
 See the [Imixs-Workflow Plugin API](http://www.imixs.org/doc/engine/plugins/index.html) for additional information.
