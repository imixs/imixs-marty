'imixs-marty' is a sub project of '[Imixs Workflow](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-workflow)'. The project provides several artefacts to build business process management solutions on the Java EE stack. The goal of this project is to simplify the development of workflow management applications by providing a robust and flexible application framework with a set of Java Enterprise components. 

The project is split in the following modules

 * imixs-marty-ejb - provides service EJBs to access the backend data
 * imixs-marty-util - contains utility classes and CDI beans
 * imixs-marty-ui (draft) - contains JSF specific UI classes


Imixs-Marty is also the base component library for the BPM Workflow Suite [Imixs-Office-Workflow](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-office-workflow)
